authorizes only Pegs based on the same side of BBO.

or

So if the Side of the Peg is Buy and the Work Reference Price is Ask, or if the Side of the Peg
is Sell and the Work Reference Price is Bid, then the Peg will be rejected GL 025.

A
(Ask)

293

Work

Mass Quote Management (request 2040)
Not supported by API Messenger.
In request 2040, data can be set in the Header (Default data below) and in the Legs. Whet is defined in the Header is set
automatically for all the Legs. But if the same field is sent in one of the Legs with a different value, it is not over written by the value of
the Header.
Example: if the Quantity is set to 10 in the Header, to 20 in the first Leg and not set in the other Legs, then:
• The SLE will consider the Quantity for the first Leg = 20
• The SLE will consider the Quantity for the other Legs = 10
On WSE just one side of a Quote can be sent. It is not mandatory to send always Bid and Ask together.
WSE supports until 150 Bids and 150 Asks in a single message. This is the maximum that has to be sent in FIS Market Data Server
API.

Order Modification
This section is to detail the secured modification of an order.

Modification of simple order:
Crossing between client and SLE:
1. Rule 1: In case of the field #44 Total Executed Quantity is filled, we decrease the quantity.
Example:
We send an order with field #1 Quantity filled by 1000.
We modify the Quantity with 1500.
If a crossing execution with the exchange happens with Quantity 500 then we receive:
An acknowledgement with quantity = 1500.
An Executed quantity = 500.
A Remain Quantity = 1000.
2. Rule 2: In case of field #37 Remain Quantity is filled then we reject.
In this particular case specify that we have to inform the remaining supposed quantity to the market before modification.
Example:
We send an order with field #1 Quantity filled by 1000.
We modify the Quantity with 1500.
If a crossing execution with the exchange happens with Quantity 500, then the SLE sends a Reject.
3. Rule 3: In case of fields #44 Total Executed Quantity and #37 Remain Quantity are filled then the Rule1 is considered.
Crossing between the SLE and the Exchange
When a crossing between the SLE and the Stock Exchange happens, the SLE is notified by the Stock Exchange of events and
postpones this information to the client.
This works in this way because the orders aren’t any more in the SLE but at the stock exchange level

Modification of Strategies
For Strategies modification, only the field #37 Remain Quantity is taken into account.
