Instrument identifiers
With UTP, WSE is introducing a new instrument classification depending on the type of trade:
• Normal instrument (for normal orders) – the Trading Code will be the ISIN code
• Instrument for Block-BISO Trades – the Trading Code will be ISIN where the last character is replaced by ‘B’
• Instrument for IPO – the Trading Code will be ISIN where the last character is replaced by ‘I’
• Instrument for Tender Offer – the Trading Code will be ISIN where the last character is replaced by ‘T’

At the end this will mean 4 different instruments disseminated on WSE side
SunGard will disseminate the instruments based on this classification. For more visibility, the mnemonic for Block-BISO, IPO and
Tender Offer will have a suffix depending on the instrument type. See the example below.
