How is this document organised
This document is made up of three sections.



The first section examines the types of variables which can be used.



The second section explores the message format. It describes the cinematic and the
format of each request. It describes also the domain values of each field.



The third section gives some remarks

Page 15 sur 224

API SLC V5

Encoding type
In GL API messages variables can take one of the five following forms:

GL coding rule


GL Format

In GL format, the first byte indicates the length of the field.
The length is calculated as following:
Contains the value + 32 in ASCII
E.g length = 7
First byte = 7 + 32 = 39 = « ‘ »

The rest is the contents of the field coded in ASCII.
E.g value = FTE
First byte = 3 + 32 = 35 = « # »
Rest = « FTE »
So the field = « #FTE »

Warning : This format imply that all the fields have a variable length.



ACSII

:

Data field in ASCII format.
E.g.

02007 coded « 02007 »



Filler

:

Field only contains spaces: ASCII char(32).



GL_C

:

Fixed length coded avers one byte.
Contains the value + 32
E.g.

value = 7
Field = 7+32=39= « ’ »

GLID
All the SLC V5 requests use a particular field: The GLID.

Page 16 sur 224

API SLC V5

The GLID indicates the couple exchanges-markets. It always follows this format:
GLID:
[EEEE] :Exchange
[SS] : Source
[MMM] : market
[SSS] : Sub-market
The domain’s values for exchange-market-source can be finding in the licsym.ini file.

For example: The GLID to Paris –Cash is: 000100002000

Page 17 sur 224

API SLC V5

Message Format
Message Structure
A GL message is a string of variable length in ASCII 8-bit format that must adhere to the
following format:
LG

HEADER

DATA

FOOTER

Where:



LG

: Total message length (including LG, Header, Data, Footer)



Header : General message information



Data



Footer : End of message

: Message data

LG
The LG section gives the total length of the message.
It is coded over 2 bytes: LG[0] and LG[1], where :



LG[0]

: LG%256 (remainder of LG/256)



LG[1]

: LG/256 (integer part of LG/256)



LG = LG[0] + 256 * LG[1]

Header
The header is of a standard fixed length of 32 bytes.

Remark: The format of the header is the same for SLC V4, SLC V5, SLE V4, SLE V5 and P3
V5.
Only the API version field changes.
For SLC V5, this field must be filled with « 0 »

V5.

Mechanism of the data feed
The rule
Each type of the request describes in this document follows this rule:

•

If [Request number] % 4 = 0 It’s a snapshot request

•

If [Request number] % 4 = 1 It’s a refreshed request

•

If [Request number] % 4 = 2 It’s a stop refresh request

•

If [Request number] % 4 = 3 It’s a real time request

Example
Example with the request “Stock Watch”

Snapshot
If you send a request Stock Watch snapshot, request 1000 you will receive only a reply
Stock Watch, request 1000.
Here, 1000 % 4 = 0. So it’s a snapshot request
1000
CLIENT

SLC
1000

Refreshed + Real time
If you send a request Stcok Watch refreshed, request 1001, you will receive a reply Stock
Watch, request 1001 and several real time reply, requests 1003.
Here, 1001 % 4 = 1. So it’s a refreshed request

1001
CLIENT

SLC
1001

N x 1003

Page 20 sur 224

API SLC V5

Stop refreshed
You can stop the real time reply by sending a request Stock Watch Stop refresh, request
1002.
Here, 1002 % 4 = 2. So it’s a stop refreshed request

CLIENT

1002

SLC

Exception
Two exceptions prove the rule. It’s the requests for the news and the resquest price enquiry.

News
Requests for the news are cutting in 2 parts, the title and the text.

The requests for the title are:
•

5033 for the refreshed request

•

5034 for the stop refresh request

•

5035 for the real time request

The request for the text is:
•

5032 for the snapshot request

Price enquiry
For this request, when you send the refresh request 1097, you never receive a snapshot.

New Market by order (5044-5045-5046-5047) [MO5]
Description
The market by orders gives information to display exchanges on a stock.
Warning: It’s recommended that you ask for a higher degree of market by order than the
client really needs. Because if you ask 50 best limits and if an order is cancelled inside these
limits, the new market by order will be reduced to the 49 new best limits.

Decoding the field using the bitmap
The bitmap is use to indicates which field are present in the reply. If the bit x is set in
the bitmap then the field x is present in the reply.The bit 7 is always set although there
is no field 7.
For example:
The bitmap is: 2E (in hexadecimal), in other words we have 10001110 in binary.
So: The fields which are present are : 1, 2, 3

For each period, the client sets a key and will use the one given
in the server’s answer to associate the period with the datas
answered

Real time with multi-thread SLC
If the SLC is configured to work with threads, it’s possible that the SLC sends updates
before sending the snapshot. To deal with these synchronization issues, the following
algorithm will have to implement:



For each requested instrument and each period requested, the client will
associate a record containing the datas relative to the start time requested
and the datas relative to the last update.



Turnover
Cumulative quantity
Turnover
Cumulative quantity

The “initial datas” part of the record will be filled upon the reception of the
snapshot.
Remark: As the VWAP computation needs “initial datas”, the VWAP
computation won’t be started before reception of the snapshot.



When updates are received, they will be stored in the “last datas” part of the
record if the cumumlative quantity contained in the message is higher
than the one contained in the record.



If a snapshot is received, the datas related to “end time” contained in the
message will be stored in the “last datas” part of the record only if the
cumulative quantity contained in the message is higher.
